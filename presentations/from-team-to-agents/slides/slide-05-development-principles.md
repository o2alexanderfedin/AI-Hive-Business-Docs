# Slide 5: Development Principles

## Agile Methodologies

### SCRUM Framework
- **Epics**: High-level business objectives
- **User Stories**: Feature descriptions from user perspective
- **Engineering Tasks**: Technical implementation details
- **Kanban Board**: Visual workflow management
- **Sprint Planning**: 2-week iterations with clear goals
- **Daily Standups**: AI agents report progress 24/7
- **Sprint Reviews**: Automated demos and stakeholder feedback
- **Retrospectives**: Continuous process improvement

### eXtreme Programming (XP) Practices
- **Pair Programming**: Human-AI collaborative coding
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Tests written before code
- **Continuous Integration**: Merge and test frequently
- **Refactoring**: Constant code improvement
- **Simple Design**: YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- **Collective Code Ownership**: All agents can modify any code
- **Sustainable Pace**: AI agents never burn out
- **On-site Customer**: Direct stakeholder access via chat

### Emergent Design
- **Evolutionary Architecture**: Design emerges from requirements
- **Incremental Development**: Small, frequent releases
- **Feedback-Driven**: Rapid iteration based on user input
- **Just-In-Time Design**: Avoid over-engineering
- **Continuous Redesign**: Adapt as understanding grows

## Core Engineering Standards

### Based on Agile Manifesto
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

### XP Values
- **Communication**: Clear, constant dialogue
- **Simplicity**: Choose the simplest solution
- **Feedback**: Learn from every iteration
- **Courage**: Make necessary changes
- **Respect**: Value all team contributions
