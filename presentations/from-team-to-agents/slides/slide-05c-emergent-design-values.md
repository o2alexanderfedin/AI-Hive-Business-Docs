# Slide 5c: Emergent Design & Core Values

## Emergent Design Principles

### Adaptive Architecture
- **[Evolutionary Design](https://martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html)**: Architecture emerges from requirements
- **[Incremental Development](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/incremental-development/)**: Small, frequent releases
- **[Just-In-Time Design](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad1/simple_design)**: Avoid premature optimization
- **[Continuous Redesign](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/EvolutionaryDesign.html)**: Refactor as understanding grows
- **[Feedback-Driven](https://www.infoq.com/articles/emergent-design-evolutionary/)**: Let user needs guide architecture

## [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) Values

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

*While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.*

## [XP Core Values](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html)

### The Foundation of Excellence

- **Communication**: Clear dialogue between all stakeholders
- **Simplicity**: Choose the simplest solution that works
- **Feedback**: Learn from every iteration and user interaction
- **Courage**: Make necessary changes without fear
- **Respect**: Value contributions from humans and AI agents alike
