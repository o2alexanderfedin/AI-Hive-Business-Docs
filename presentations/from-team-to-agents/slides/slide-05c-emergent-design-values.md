# Slide 5c: Emergent Design & Core Values

## Emergent Design Principles

### Adaptive Architecture
- **Evolutionary Design**: Architecture emerges from requirements
- **Incremental Development**: Small, frequent releases
- **Just-In-Time Design**: Avoid premature optimization
- **Continuous Redesign**: Refactor as understanding grows
- **Feedback-Driven**: Let user needs guide architecture

## Agile Manifesto Values

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

*While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.*

## XP Core Values

### The Foundation of Excellence

- **Communication**: Clear dialogue between all stakeholders
- **Simplicity**: Choose the simplest solution that works
- **Feedback**: Learn from every iteration and user interaction
- **Courage**: Make necessary changes without fear
- **Respect**: Value contributions from humans and AI agents alike
