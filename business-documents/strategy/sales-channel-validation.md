## Conclusion

The validated demand through Web Summit (80% interest), EntSpace partnership (200 participants/month), and UAE hub discussions fundamentally changes AI Hive's growth trajectory. The original "aggressive" targets are now conservative given these proven channels.

**Key Takeaway**: We're not speculating about demand - we have three validated channels ready to deliver 100+ customers per month.
